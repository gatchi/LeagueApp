+ add internet connectivity check

Things Done Since Last Commit
=============================
- remove/move unecessary files in src
+ replace champ name string array id system with JSON option
+ champList now saves to a file, and is passed into ChampInfo activity
+ partially implemented champion icon & details downloading via champ_list
+ changed order of arguments for writeTextFile so its easier to remember
+ allow download of first four champs
o fix'd data downloading and ChampInfo functioning
+ added a very basic logging system (needs testing)
- deleted raw directory in res
- deleted xml directory in res
- deleted icons in drawable directory
o test logging system
