Goals for Some Other Day
========================
+ get downloads from latest version
+ allow download of first four champs
+ add all the other champs
	- put them all in their directories with proper names
		o maybe make a script for this
	- add all the buttons
+ get an open source license for LeagueApp (or at least look into it)
+ maybe publish to github

Things Done Already Today
=========================
- removed dead code
+ half implemented icon download... it was working but now its not, cause i
+ implemented folder system for data (champs, drawable)
+ implemented FilesAsyncHttpResponseHandler (an abstract subclass of AsyncHttpResponseHandler)
+ encapsulated the champlist downloading, saving, and loading into one method that throws a FileNotFound exception, so if it fails it doesnt crash the whole app anymore
