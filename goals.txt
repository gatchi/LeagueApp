Things Done Already Today
=========================
! icon downloading broken cause two sync requests are running at the same time, and wont block each other
x tried to fix this by limiting their thread pool but threads start immediately upon creation
o instead, im changing the download method to take in a queue
x this doesnt work either unless the queue is accessed from the handler
? maybe a better workaround is synchronized threads
o problem was fixed by moving file location to public variables instead of within the handler
x ALL OF THIS IS BULLSHIT I SHOULDNT HAVE EVEN USED THIS ASYNC HTTP LIBRARY THE TOOLS WERE ALREADY HERE
o after seemingly forever, icon downloading is now fixed
