Goals for Today
===============
o test every champ entry for accuracy
o test fresh download
o clean up code

Goals for Some Other Day
========================
+ progress bar or something
+ fix refresh issue
+ get downloads from latest version
+ add all the other champs
	- put them all in their directories with proper names
		o maybe make a script for this
	- add all the buttons
+ make it so that runtime reconfigurations (like screen orientation changes) dont fuck up async
+ add internet connectivity check
+ dark theme (themes in general eventually, w/ customization)
+ drops unecessary decimal zeroes
o maybe make it so that decimal attack speed is updated per level
+ on ChampInfo: settings, verbose (more precision) or simple (less precision)

Things Done Since Last Commit
=============================
o tested maintaining of 5 champs
+ TableLayout, parameters for adding rows (LinearLayouts)
o tested maintaining of 100 champs
o tested maintaining of 200 champs
	! stopped loading/downloading at 160 (Poppy) for some reason, champList iterator "no such element"
- removed unused library imports
o code can now load all champs!! (changed for loops to whiles with iterator.hasNext()'s)
o tweaked code for displaying stat precision (more precision)
- disabled "clear data" button; easier & more efficient to just delete whole folders manually
